where it was violated?
 1. PdfExpoter tightens the precondition 

 2. Json expoter handles null differently
    other expoter would throw  nullpointer exceptions 
    that breaks substituability (lsp violated)

 3. CsvExpoter changes the data  
    caller expect the same data 
    data semantics changed (lsp violated)


How to solve it?

1. define clear base contract : centralized null handiling 

2. In the json Expoter we remove the speacial null behaviour 
   becuase we have handled in the base class 

3. as mentioned we have to keep the output same
