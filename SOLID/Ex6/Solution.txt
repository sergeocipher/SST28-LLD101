What was violated?
 - in the  base case never stated that the phoneNo must start with "+" 
   But subclass WhatsappSender added a stricter rule 
   Tightened the precondition 

 - In the EmailSender  we silenetly truncated the message greater than 40 
   caller thinks the full meassge is sent 
   subclass modifies secretly 

 - Base class was vague do not define inout validation null validation etc 

 How we solve then ?
  - we made base contract explicit  like centralized null validation 
  - remove hidden truncated behaviour rather throw error
