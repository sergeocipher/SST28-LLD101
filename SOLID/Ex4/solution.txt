Where it was violated?

1. switch-case room : if add a new room we must change the core logic 
    this vilated OCP 

2. Add-on branching : we must change the core logic 
    this violates OCP 

3. HostelFeeCalculator is calculating fee , printing recipt , saving booking 
   this violates srp 

how we solve them ?

 - create a interface Pricecomponent  anything contributes to total fee 

- encapsulated roomPricing and addonPricing 

- updated calculator we remove switch 
 it does not know prices it just sums it
